# Django Form Class
Django provides a new way to work with forms, using the **form** class. You can design the form layout and data validation using python code.

### With it you can:
- Set validation cases, including custom ones.
- Set `error_messages`
- Set input special types
- Render form as `inline`, `p` or `table`
- Instantiate a form with previous values (edit form)
